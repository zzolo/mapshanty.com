"The Map Shanty is a place of warmth, color, and upside down thought. It is a place in the middle of a lake. It is a place where maps change the way you look at the world."

The Map Shanty and mapshanty.com lived in 2009 on Medicine Lake in Minneapolis, MN as part of the Art Shanty project.

This is an archive of that site.  

## Installation

This is a Drupal 6 site.  This has not been fully worked out.  Due to some hard coding paths and switch from site based config to default, things are a bit messy.  Good luck.

* Database dump (coming soon)
* Do note that there is DB prefix:  ```$db_prefix = 'dr6_';```
